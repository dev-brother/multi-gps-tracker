# multi-gps-tracker
quick roll out to track multiple gps devices

This project is currently in heavy rework. It looks like this will be a full split away from the original project at https://github.com/herverenault/Self-Hosted-GPS-Tracker.

Major issues currently being reworked.

* Secure login.
* Multiple devices management on server.
* Sqlite for fast rollout - drop and run.
* Rework android app for device id.
* Rework android ui for extended functionality.
* Separate the server project code from the android project code.
* Full project rename to PunchButton.
